# Obsidian Graph Search Hotkey

This is a simple plugin so you can set a hotkey to switch to the search bar in the Graph view. It is Alt+f as a default.
For now it is not possible to use ctrl+f as a hotkey since I could not figure out a way to use context based hotkeys in Obsidian.

## Settings
You can add a default search string. This will help you if you dont want certain folders per default in your graph view, like the journals or the assets folder.
